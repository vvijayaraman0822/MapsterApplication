# Mapster Documentation (Group Project)

## Description
#### Application Purpose
Mapster is a social networking application that allows users to share their location with a community of friends using pictures as the primary source of interaction (Imagine an Instagram and Snapchat offspring). Users will have the ability to search users or photos within a certain radius of their location in order to expand their Mapster community. Add to your profile by posting your own images or geolocation, all of which are viewable to those you allow.

**Features:**
* Take/Share images with geolocation attached and add to user profile
* View images taken within a given radius of your location
* Add/Remove friends to increase your reached demographic
* Allow friends (or all users) to locate you via a pin displayed on a map.
* Search and Connect with users within a given radius of your location.
* Ability to navigate to photo/friend location via map pins
* Send and Receive messages from friends and others
