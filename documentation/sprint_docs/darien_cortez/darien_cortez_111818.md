## Description of Sprint


Mackey and I started out by cloning Brice's original uiux branch and got it running, but his 
work wasn't pushed over at the time so we had to wait. After the work was pushed, we kept
getting a 'build' error while running the "git fetch && checkout uiux-menu" command. We
solved the error by including the ignored "ionic config.json" file and connected the branch
to our own firebase. There were many other errors because of ignored files, and after finally
pasting all the files over we ran into a "Runtime" error. We decided to end the session at this point.
