## Description of Sprint


I was having problems pushing anything to github so I spent some time trying to push my sprint docs over and Brice found
that I made the stupid mistake of not accepting his request of being a collaborator. Yeah.. stupid, I know. I kept having problems
getting runtime errors and this entire time because of that Brice was stuck doing alot of the uiux styling and what not. I pulled
Brice aside and told him I felt bad because I felt I was not contributing enough because I can't get the app showing on my laptop.
So this week I'm going to try and meet with him to fix the errors and he suggested I'd switch gears to work on messaging and other
neccesities.
