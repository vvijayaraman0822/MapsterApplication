## Description of Sprint
Zac and I pretty much got together and coded since day 1. We set up our project and began working on the camera portion. We ran into several 
errors with both xcode and building in ionic. We spent several days trying to fix the building bug,
and Shady helped us figure it out. After fixing the bug we got the camera's basic functionalities to work. 
The camera does not work as intended yet, but will be finished in the next sprint. Zac commited our code
to the camera branch of the main repo. Currently we have a takePicture function that lets the user take a picture, uploadPicture function
that lets user upload a image from Camera Roll and cropPicture function that lets user crop the picture. This function is intended
to be used for profile pictures which will enable us to keep all the profile pictures kind of the same.
